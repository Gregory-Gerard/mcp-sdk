# Model Context Protocol PHP SDK

Model Context Protocol SDK for Client and Server applications in PHP.

**This Component is experimental**.
[Experimental features](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html)
are not covered by Symfony's
[Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).

## Installation

```bash
composer require symfony/mcp-sdk
```

This is a low level SDK that implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
(MCP). The protocol is used by LLM model to build "plugins" and give them extra
context. Example the logged in users' latest order.
